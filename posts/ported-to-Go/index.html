            More than a year ago, I was relly excited to build this site with
            Astro, a popular static site generator. However, that excitement
            ended up to not last very long.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="post-content">
          <p>
            This site is now written with
            <a href="https://github.com/zilllaiss/FEST">FEST</a>, a minimalistic
            static-site generator I made. I want to say that it is
            <em>ported</em> since the new source code for is one-to-one with
            original code written in Astro-js in most area, but there are some
            big changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the change is in the routing. Astro follow a folder-based
            routing. That means you make a folder with route name yous wish, and
            in that folder you made a <code>index.html</code>. Most of JS
            frameworks have similar features for routing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, the routing in Go is more similar to router library like Chi
            (actually one of my inspiration) or Express.js.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another big change that I had to make is that I need to implemented
            convert Markdown files myself, although it is easily handled as Go
            libraries for that already exists.
          </p>

          <h2 id="the-reasons-why">The Reasons Why.</h2>
          <p>
            Every time I revisit my blog, something breaks. Whenever I opened
            the site, thinking about writing or tweaking something to my
            site—and instead, I was greeted with warnings, API and documentation
            changes, and worse—security issues. To me it's funny that a
            static-site generator has security issues, but knowing Astro has a
            lot more features, I suppose it's natural for it to have them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really wanted to ignore those as I only use it for static-site,
            but literally npm told me that there are
            <em>20 vulnerabilities</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be fair, this isn’t strictly Astro’s fault. This is a broader
            issue with the JavaScript ecosystem—where even doing
            <em>nothing</em> can result in things silently breaking over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s hard to stay motivated when you feel like you're constantly
            fixing instead of building.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want is stability. I only need a static website. No need for
            constant upgrades just to keep things from falling apart. That’s why
            I wrote my own static site generator in Go—using
            <a href="https://templ.guide/">Templ</a>. It's minimal, fast, and
            worry-free. I’ve been using Go and Templ intensively for the past
            two years, and I love the DX that comes along with it.
          </p>
          <h2 id="afterthought">Afterthought</h2>
          <p>
            Astro is still good, just not for me, It’s well-designed, and for a
            lot of people it’s the right choice. But it’s made to be a
            feature-rich platform—a part of the fast-evolving JavaScript world.
            That means it comes with a long tail of dependencies and
            expectations for maintenance.
          </p>
          <p>That’s just not what I want right now.</p>
          <h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I’m migrating from Sass to plain CSS. Sass doesn’t break as often,
              but it still does occasionally. I also considered Tailwind, but
              using it with Templ is not a good of an idea. Go build is fast,
              but if you need to change something in HTML will need you to
              rebuild the binary. So it can get pretty tedious fast.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I do use 'hot-reload', which is a combination of Task (aka. go-task)
            and live-server, so it's not that bad. However, different with HTML
            files itself, I often thinker the styling, so having it rebuild the
            binary every time for CSS change is the last thing I want.
          </p>
          <p>
            And frankly, I just love a more minimalistic choice when it is make
            sense to do so (and most of the time do).
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I’ll finish the site. Most of the pages are unfinished. Actually,
              most of them haven't. The ones that I considered &quot;mostly
              finished&quot; are the Blog and Post pages.
